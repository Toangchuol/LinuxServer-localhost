Steps I’ve taken setting up the file server NFS in linux environments
└─$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
└─$ sudo mkdir /mnt/myshareddir                               
created directory where my the NFS shares will be, the export folder for my file server
└─$ sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/myshareddir
removing onwnership of the File server
└─$ sudo chmod 777 /mnt/myshareddir           
giving everyone on all groups all connected access to modify files(Reda, Write, Execute)

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[/etc]
└─$ sudo vim /etc/exports
enable access to a single client
/mnt/myshareddir {clientIP}(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

From the configuration file of the File Server 

The remaining configurations are for the clients-side
